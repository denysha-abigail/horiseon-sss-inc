# Welcome to Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

### Description:

At Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc., users can now access screen reader assistive technologies from a modified code structure intended to enhance web accessibility and functionality.

*Bug fixes: Non-semantic HTML elements were replaced with semantic ones to define and distinguish between the type of content displayed. CSS utility classes were created to rename component classes for reusable purposes to eliminate DRY code. Webpage title was added and links were adjusted accordingly for page redirection to their corresponding sections.* 

> For further evaluation, please review HTML and CSS comment tags.
